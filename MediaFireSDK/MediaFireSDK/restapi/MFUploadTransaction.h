/**
  @brief Uploads a file to the cloud.
 
  The desired file's path is passed as an NSString to MFUploadTransaction
  during initialization. If the file represented by the given file path
  is not existing or not readable by the app, the upload will fail.
 
  To start the upload process, call start or startWithCallbacks. To cancel,
  call cancel.
 
  Callbacks are represented by a NSDictionary with ONLOAD, ONERROR,
  ONPROGRESS, ONUPDATE blocks. Each block has a NSDictionary parameter
  that can expected nested NSDictionaries for following keys: "fileInfo" and
  "response". The "fileInfo" dictionary contains the following
  keys: UFILENAME, UFILEHASH, UFILEPATH, USTATUS, UUPLOADKEY, UQUICKKEY,
  UUNITCOUNT, UFILESIZE, UUNITSIZE, ULASTUNIT. The objects for these keys
  are NSNumbers or NSStrings.
  The "response" dictionary will be an MFErrorMessage or dictionary with
  key UEVENT (and UCHUNKID key if object for key UEVENT matches UECHUNK).
  These blocks are called on successful or failed uploads as well as multiple
  times for status changes. The same callback property may be used for
  multiple MFUploadTransactions.
